To some extent this is correct, since bitcoin is the most famous asset and its growth has been quite significant lately. On the other hand, any professional trader and investor knows that the most important aspect of success is diversification. Accordingly, it is desirable to buy not only bitcoin, but also other cryptocurrencies. In this case, the fall of one of them can be compensated by the growth of the other. Another recommendation for beginner crypto traders is to find opportunities for arbitrage. This is one of the simplest strategies, which, at least, does not require any knowledge and does not require the study of crypto trading. The essence of this technique is that the trader is looking for a difference in prices for the same asset on two or more exchanges. When he finds such a difference, he takes advantage of the moment and profits from it."
